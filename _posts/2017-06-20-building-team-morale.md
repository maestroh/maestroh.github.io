### Progress
1. nothing makes devs happier than making quick progress
2. getting stuff behind them and to change focus to new things keeps the atmosphere upbeat

### My Way (Really Their Way)
1. Give people space to be creative
2. People know their own strenghts and weaknesses, and can take advantage of those strengths in ways you may not understand
3. If someone says they can do something, give them the resources they need. They will usually surprise you
4. When people take responsibility and succeed, they will be much happier
5. If you tell people how to do stuff, and they try to do it your way and fail, they'll blame you
6. If they do it their way and fail, they'll learn
