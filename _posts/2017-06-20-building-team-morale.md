title: Building Team Morale
---



### Progress
Why this is important:
1. nothing makes devs happier than making quick progress
2. getting stuff behind them and to change focus to new things keeps the atmosphere upbeat
3. skips over the small problems and focuses on the hard ones
4. quick progress leads to happy stakeholders which givevs the team purpose
How:
1. break tasks into small chunks 
2. organize tasks into logical groups
3. identify when a logical group has completed


### My Way (Really Their Way)
Why this is important:
1. People know their own strenghts and weaknesses, and can take advantage of those strengths in ways you may not understand
2. When people take responsibility and succeed, they will be much happier
3. If you tell people how to do stuff, and they try to do it your way and fail, they'll blame you
4. If they do it their way and fail, they'll learn

How:
1. Give people space to be creative
2. If someone says they can do something, give them the resources they need. They will usually surprise you


### Don't Micromanage
Why this is important:
1. Micromanaging sends a signal that you don't trust your team
2. Turns the leader into a bottleneck
3. People won't be able to think for themselves
4. Software developers are creative. Micromanaging kills that creativity.

How:
1. Instead of micromanaging, set goals and keep repeating. See the next section

### Set Clear Goals
Why this is important:
1. You may have the total vision in your head
2. Setting clear goals and expectations gives people assurance that they are moving the same direction
3. Clear goals, rather than micromanaged instructions, allows people to think for themselves and move towards the goal their  own way
4. Setting goals allows leaders to reduce their own workload 

How:
1. Define the goals
2. Repeat goals regularly
3. Connect actions with goals

### Create A Process That Fits
Why this is important:
1. Freedom is a great way to make sure creativity flourishes
2. Too much freedom leads to no accountability
3. The right process can constrain a team just enough to push them in the right direction
4. Think of process as guard rails. You want to keep the path wide open, but don't want anyone to fall off the cliff

How:
1. Each team is different and expectations for that team's delivery and external communication is different
2. 

### Block the BS (Give Uninterrupted Time)
1. Allow devs to focus
2. Block any irrelivant items
3. Only interrupt devs if the reason is a higher priority than what they're working on and is urgent!
4. 


### Give Growth Opportunities
1. Provide new paths for team members
2. Always stretch team members ability
3. Keep people out of their comfort zone with the promise of growth
4. Pay attention to stress levels to make sure you don't over do it

### Limit Silos or Cross train
1. Share the load between developers
2. Don't make a dev responsible for just one thing
3. They get bored and stuck 
4. Change it up and make it interesting

### Give Praise
1. Let's people know when they've moved towards goals
2. Creates a positive environment
3. 

### Create An Educational Environment
1. Enourage everyone to learn
2. Encourages growth

### Ask Questions Before Shooting Down Ideas

### Create An Environment Of Honest Criticism (Don't let bad feelings fester)

### Momentum

### Burnout

### Change It Up

### Have Fun
