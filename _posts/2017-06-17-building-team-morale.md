title: Building Team Morale
---
Everyone wants a highly productive team. It can be a delicate balance. If you push your teams too hard, they'll stress out. If you don't push enough, they won't produce. Cracking the whip isn't the only way of encouraging your team to produce. Actually, putting pressure on them is probably the least effective way. I've worked in all kinds of environments before. The best teams are the ones that give team members the indepedence to shine. Those are the least stressful and most productive environments you can create.

## Team Types
Understanding different team types will help you to identify key characteristics of your team.

Teams can fall along 2 axes; one for productivity and one for mood. The vertical dimension is productivity where high productivity is at the top. The horizontal dimension is mood where the team members are happier in the  positive direction. The graph above breaks teams down into 4 types based on these criteria. Each type of team has its own characteristics. Perhaps you've worked on some of these teams. Identifying where you team lies on these dimensions could help you move towards getting your team "In The Zone".

### Disfunctional Teams
Disfunctional teams are run by fear. Either the team members are afraid of making a mistake. Or the team's manager is afraid of looking bad. Whatever the reason, these teams are constantly scared. The energy spent dealing with these fears creates a toxic environment. Lots of folks are gossipping and finger pointing leading to high turn over. Blame gets spread around and no one takes responsibility. 

### Blissful Teams
These teams are hyperfocused on people and have low turnover as a result. Team members are happy on these teams and can't imagine it could get any better. But it can get better. Products delivered by these teams are not always in line with business needs. There is a lack accountability, and team members will have low ambition since there's no reason to leave. 

### Micromanaged Teams
Micromanaged teams focus on metrics that lead to value for the company, but are the wrong metrics for the team to excel. Metrics could include budget or time instead of delivering a high quality product. Or the team could spend a lot of time playing CYA as to not take responsibility for any mistakes. The tight restriction on the wrong focus removes any decisions individuals could make leading to less job fulfillment and high turnover.

### In The Zone
Focus: business vision
Result: High morale, high productivity low waste, high individual fulfullment, low stress, light atmosphere, having  fun
Teams get in the zone when they align their effort with business vision. 



Low producing teams fall into two categories: micromanaged and stressed, or happy and unsctructured. High producing teams tend to be happy and structured.

High producing teams balance micromanagement and being loose, or happiness, or 

Leading technical teams can be tough. 

You want your teams to have high productivity, but you don't want to crack the whip. 

Focusing on high morale can help you to maximize productivy. 

High morale is one of the core characteristics of high performing teams.
