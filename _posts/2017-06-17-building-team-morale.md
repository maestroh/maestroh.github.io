Everyone wants their team to be a highly productive. It can be a delicate balance. If you push your teams too hard, they'll stress out. If you don't push enough, they won't produce. Cracking the whip isn't the only way of encouraging your team to produce. Actually, putting pressure on them is probably the least effective way. I've worked in all kinds of environments before. The best teams are the ones that give team members the indepedence to shine. Those are the least stressful and most productive environments you can create.

## Team Types
![Team Types](/img/teamTypes.png)

Teams can fall along 2 axes; one for productivity and one for mood. The vertical dimension is productivity where high productivity is at the top. The horizontal dimension is mood where the team members are happier in the  positive direction. The graph above breaks teams down into 4 types based on these criteria. Each type of team has its own characteristics. Perhaps you've worked on some of these teams. Identifying where you team lies on these dimensions could help you move towards getting your team "In The Zone".

### Disfunctional Teams
These teams have no structure. The process in place is poor and the atmosphere is toxic. You might have a lot of folks gossiping and you probably have a lot of turn over. Blame gets spread around and no one takes responsibility. The focus of these teams has nothing to do with the team success. You might see this situation if a team is seen as a cost center by a company. The focus changes from delivery to cutting costs or not screwing up in general. 

### Blissful Teams
These teams probably have some structure. The focus of these teams may be retention, as a result, you may see low turnover. Team members are happy on these teams and can't imagine it could get any better. However, it can get better. These teams may produce, but the delivered product may not be inline with the business needs. There is probably a lack accountability, and team members will have low ambition since there's no reason to leave. 

Low producing teams fall into two categories: micromanaged and stressed, or happy and unsctructured. High producing teams tend to be happy and structured.

High producing teams balance micromanagement and being loose, or happiness, or 

Leading technical teams can be tough. 

You want your teams to have high productivity, but you don't want to crack the whip. 

Focusing on high morale can help you to maximize productivy. 

High morale is one of the core characteristics of high performing teams.
