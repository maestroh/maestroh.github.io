Everyone wants their team to be a highly productive. It can be a delicate balance. If you push your teams too hard, they'll stress out. If you don't push enough, they won't produce. Cracking the whip isn't the only way of encouraging your team to produce. Actually, putting pressure on them is probably the least effective way. I've worked in all kinds of environments before. The best teams are the ones that give team members the indepedence to shine. Those are the least stressful and most productive environments you can create.

## Team Types
![Team Types](/img/teamTypes.png)

Teams can fall along 2 axes; one for productivity and one for mood. The vertical dimension is productivity where high productivity is at the top. The horizontal dimension is mood where the team members are happier in the  positive direction. The graph above breaks teams down into 4 types based on these criteria. Each type of team has its own characteristics. Perhaps you've worked on some of these teams. Identifying where you team lies on these dimensions could help you move towards getting your team "In The Zone".

### Disfunctional Teams
Disfunctional teams are run by fear. Either the team members are afraid of making a mistake. Or the team's manager is afraid of looking bad. Whatever the reason, these teams are constantly scared. The energy spent on address fears distracts from organization and process. The process in place is poor and the atmosphere is toxic. You might have a lot of folks gossiping and you probably have a lot of turn over. Blame gets spread around and no one takes responsibility. The focus of these teams has nothing to do with the team's success. You  see this situation if a team is seen as a cost center by a company. The focus changes from delivery to cutting costs or not screwing up in general. 

### Blissful Teams
These teams have some structure. These teams are hyperfocused on retention and have low turnover as a result. Team members are happy on these teams and can't imagine it could get any better. But it can get better. Products delivred by these teams are not always inlice with business needs. There is a lack accountability, and team members will have low ambition since there's no reason to leave. 

### Micromanaged Teams
These teams have lots of structure. The metrics focused on (?) by these teams could be inline with business outcomes, but aren't the right metrics to make the team excel. Metrics could include budget or time instead of delivering a high quality product. Or the team could spend a lot of time playing CYA as to not take responsibility for any mistakes. The tight restriction on the wrong focus removes any decisions individuals could make leading to less job fulfillment and high turnover.

Low producing teams fall into two categories: micromanaged and stressed, or happy and unsctructured. High producing teams tend to be happy and structured.

High producing teams balance micromanagement and being loose, or happiness, or 

Leading technical teams can be tough. 

You want your teams to have high productivity, but you don't want to crack the whip. 

Focusing on high morale can help you to maximize productivy. 

High morale is one of the core characteristics of high performing teams.
