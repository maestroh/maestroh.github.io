title: Guidance For New Software Developers
---


I always get asked where new devs should focus to start their careers. Your best bet is to rise above the rapid pace of technology changes and spend some time on key fundamentals. Fundamentals will help you grow no matter what language or tech stack you've chosen to follow. I spend a lot of time guiding members of my team to build intuition about the actions they can take to level up quickly. Here are my thoughts, right or wrong, on what makes the best developers.

## Read
Read! Read books. Read tweets. Read RFCs. Read articles. Read newsletters. Read, Read, Read! Try to expand your horizons. Read about stuff that might interest you in a couple of years. Spend time learning about new technologies or best practices you keep hearing about. Reading helps to broaden your vision so you don't get siloed in one tech stack or way of thinking.

## Practice
Reading is worthless if it's only knowledge in your head. And I don't care how much you read, you won't understand a technology unless you try it out. You'll be able to speak about it, and may know what you're talking about. You may have read so much, you can even talk your way through an interview. But the moment you're asked to follow through on your knowledge, you'll be stuck. Practicing is as important as reading. It's what builds muscle memory so you know where to start when you're given a task. Start working on your github profile. Write a react app. Write a node app. Write a python app. Start playing with webpage design, machine learning or anything that may interest you. Your github projects don't have to be perfect. I say forget perfection and shoot for quantity. Expose yourself to as many technologies as you can. Have fun with it. Don't get bogged down in making something beautiful and perfect. Do enough grow your technical toolbox. 

## Write Ugly Code That Works
You'll hear a lot about using best practices when writing your code. It's hard to remember best practices when you use a technology for the first time. You're trying to build something new and make it nice when you create and follow best practices. It's like trying to remodel your kitchen and keep it clean at the same time. Forget that! Write bad code. Understand it. Make it work. Clean it up later. You'll move faster and it will be much less stressful.

## Refactor
It's time to clean up that ugly code. It's called "refactoring" in software lingo. Get into the habit of rewriting your code. You would never consider a rough draft of a paper to be final copy. The same thing goes for code. Your ugly code is a rough draft. Now that it's  all written and working, it's time to refactor and to focus on best practices. You know what to write because you've spend the time understanding the code. You can now focus on making it look nice without having to worry too much about how to make it work.

## Write Tests


## Learn Best Practices
- SOLID Principles
- Design Patterns
- Idiomatic Code
- Use built in tools before relying on external modules. 

## Deploy Some Code
Coding is more than writing software. There's also the deployment and maintenance of a project. You'll learn a lot about maintainable code by taking code you've written and deploying  it to a server.

## Remember Your Peers
The rule of thumb for how to write good code is to remember your peers. If a stranger looks at your code, will they know what you were trying to do. Use comments. Keep your functions short. Use descriptive names for classes, variables and functions.
