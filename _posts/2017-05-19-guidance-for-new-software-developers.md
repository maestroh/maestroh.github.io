title: Guidance For New Software Developers
---

I've enjoyed my career in software development and I reguraly get asked where new devs should spend their time and focus. Software development is complicated and changes fast. As a developer, your best bet is to rise above the rapid pace and spend some time on key fundementals that will help you grow no matter what path you've chosen to follow. I spend a lot of time guiding members of my team to try to help them build some intuition around what actions they can take that will help them to level up quickly. Here are my thoughts, right or wrong, on what I believe makes the best developers.

## Read
Read! Read books. Read tweets. Read RFCs. Read articles. Read newsletters. Read, Read, Read! Try to expand your horizons. Read about stuff that might interest you in a couple of years. If you keep hearing about some new technology or best practice, spend the time to quickly learn about the subject and why it might be important. Reading helps to broaden your vision so you don't get siloed in one tech stack or way of thinking.

## Practice
Reading is worthless if it's just knowledge in your head. And I don't care how much you read, you won't fully understand a technology unless you try it out. You'll be able to speak about it, and may know what you're talking about. You may have read so much, you can even talk your way through an interview. But the moment you're asked to follow through on your knowledge, you'll be stuck. Practicing is just as important as reading. It's what builds muscle memory so you know where to start when you're given a task. Start working on your github profile. Write a react app. Write a node app. Write a python app. Start playing with machine learning or building bots or whatever you've decided may interest you. Your github projects don't have to be perfect. I would say screw perfection and shoot for quantity. Expose yourself to as many technologies as you can. Have fun with it. Don't get bogged down in making something beautiful and perfect. Do enough grow your technical toolbox. 

## Write Ugly Code That Works

## Refactor

## Write Tests

## Learn Best Practices
- SOLID Principles
- Design Patterns
- Idiomatic Code
- Use built in tools before relying on external modules. 

## Deploy Some Code
Coding is more than just writing software. There's also the deployment and maintenance of a project. Learning to take code from your IDE to a server will teach you a lot when it comes to building maintainable software. 

## Remember Your Peers
The rule of thumb for how to write good code is to remember your peers. If a stranger looks at your code, will they know what your were trying to accomplish. Use comments. Keep your functions short. Use descriptive names for classes, variables and functions.
